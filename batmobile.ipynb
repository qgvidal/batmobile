    "##### Hi Guys Cristopher Nolan is here. Don't talk about this, but I am making a new Batman movie and I need your help to design the new Batmobile. For this ocassion I would like you to design it as several Python Classes.\n",
    "##### - Design the main Batmobile class with the following attributes: Pilot (It could be Batman or Robin), number of batrockets loaded, number of pem (this are electromagnetic pulses to counter the Joker weapons) uses left, liters of gas left in the batmobile\n",
    "##### - Add the following methods to the Batmobile class: A method to accelerate the batmobile and drive for some distance, a method to activate the turbo and drive for some distance faster than the normal method, a method to launch a rocket to a Joker colleague, a method to launch a pem use.\n",
    "##### - Create the following classes to interact with the Batmobile: Joker, Joker Villain, Rocket, PEM Pulse.\n",
    "##### - The Joker and Jokker Villain class should have a parameter called KO which will turn to True when they receive a Rocket. They also have a parameter called Weapon which should turn to false if they receive a PEM Pulse. \n",
    "##### - The Rocket and PEM Pulse are the ammunition of the Batmobile, the car can only use the weapons if it has ammunition in the arsenal.\n",
    "##### - Finally draw a diagram of the classes using diagram.io showing how they interact."
